        <h1>FLYERCONNECT PRIVACY POLICY</h1>
        <p>We at FlyerConnect and Yectep Studios care about your privacy. We understand that especially when it comes
            to social networking and public websites, privacy is an important asset, one that must be protected in
            order to maintain a safe and secure environment.</p>
        <p>We appreciate your continued trust in our service and company. Let us here give you an explanation and 
            introduce you to our policies when it comes to protecting you, your information and your identity.</p>
        <h1>WHAT PERSONAL DATA IS HELD?</h1>
        <p>Yectep Studios relies on a persistent connection with various online services in order to minimize the 
            amount of private information we store on our own servers. By signing up, you will link your registered
            Facebook account with FlyerConnect. When a connection is first made, our server will, for efficiency
            purposes, cache your <strong>first and last names</strong> and <strong>Facebook user ID number</strong>.</p>
        <p>This information is used so that we do not need to contact external websites for your information. Since
            our service only connects a number of services, we only wish to access your information if a need arises.</p>
        <p>Knowing your Facebook ID and by logging in to the service, you will grant our application permission to
            post on you or your friends walls. You can turn this feature off in our control panel.</p>
        <h1>WHAT INFORMATION IS AUTOMATICALLY GATHERED?</h1>
        <p>In addition to asking explicitly for permission to access publishing rights on your Facebook account and
            caching your name, our application will collect completely anonymous statistics regarding your stay on
            this web site. We may use cookies via a third-party service to track your activity throughout this site
            (and only this website). We use this information to learn more about our visitors so that we may continually
            improve the service we provide to the greatest number of users.</p>
        <p>Some of this information is kept using the Google Analytics website statistics software. This is an online
            service and you may opt-out using a browser add-on. For more information visit
